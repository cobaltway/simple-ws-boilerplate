# Simple WS Boilerplate

A very simple Express + WS server for learning purpose.

Files are small and heavily commented, and they should preferably be read in that order:
- server.js (entry point of the server)
- server-http.js
- server-ws.js
- interval.js
- public/index.html
- public/script.js

# Setup
Run `npm install`

# Use
Run `node server.js`
The http server default port is 3000, so the app should be availible on:
`http://localhost:3000/`
